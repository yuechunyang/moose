# SelfAux

!syntax description /AuxKernels/SelfAux

This can be used to make a copy of a field variable, for example to change the variable type.
Since most `AuxKernels` can use variables as arguments, without modifying them, and store the
result in a separate variable, the `SelfAux` is generally not required, and its use is highly situational.
